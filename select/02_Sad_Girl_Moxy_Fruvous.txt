Sad girl,
Taking every cue from every ad, girl.
Hopelessness is easy when it's a fad, girl.
And being good is only when you're a bad girl.
Sad girl,
Maybe you've got every reason in this mad world.
Sad girl,
Showing there is nothing you want to be.
Rejecting anyone who loves you truly.
And holding that expression like it's a duty.
Sad girl,
What is it that makes you such a beauty?
Once in a while, to hold your head high
Would leave you a sell out.
Resigned to ask why, devoted to die,
When everything that you've been told,
By any person that you hold,
When any happiness and love will
Give you every reason to lie.
Sad girl,
Taking every cure from every ad, girl.
Depression is romantic when it's a fad, girl.
And being good in only when you're a bad girl.
Sad girl,
Maybe you've got every reason in this mad world.
Sad girl,
Maybe you've got every reason in this man's world.
Sad girl.
